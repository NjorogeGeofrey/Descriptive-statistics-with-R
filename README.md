# Descriptive-statistics-with-R
README for Descriptive Statistics and Data Exploration (R Code)
Overview:
This set of R code snippets focuses on exploring and analyzing the mtcars dataset, covering descriptive statistics, measures of central tendency, measures of dispersion, and data visualization.

Instructions:
Loading Data:
The code starts by loading the mtcars dataset.
data(mtcars)
Dataset Overview:
Use the following commands to inspect the structure and dimensions of the dataset:
str(mtcars)
dim(mtcars)
names(mtcars)
Viewing Data:
Examine the first 5 rows of the dataset using:

head(mtcars, n=5)
Descriptive Statistics:
Calculate various measures of central tendency and dispersion.
mean(mtcars$mpg, na.rm = TRUE)
median(mtcars$mpg)
Mode Calculation:
A custom function get_mode is defined to calculate the mode.
get_mode <- function(x) {
  unique_x <- unique(x)
  unique_x[which.max(tabulate(match(x, unique_x)))]
}

mode_value <- get_mode(mtcars$mpg)
print(mode_value)
Other Descriptive Statistics:
Additional calculations including range, quantiles, and boxplots.
range(mtcars$mpg)
quantile(mtcars$mpg, 0.5)
boxplot(mtcars$mpg)
Measures of Dispersion:
Variance and standard deviation calculations.

var(mtcars$mpg)
sd(mtcars$mpg)
Summary and Visualization:
Generate summary statistics and boxplots.
summary(mtcars$mpg)
boxplot(mtcars$gear ~ mtcars$mpg)
Data Exploration:
Explore the dataset using functions like View, descr, and dfsummary.

View(mtcars)
descr(mtcars)
dfsummary(mtcars)

Usage:
Copy and paste the relevant code snippets into an R environment.
Execute the code to see the results and visualizations.
Customize as needed for your specific analysis or research.
Note:
The code assumes that the mtcars dataset is available in your R environment.
Additional functions and visualizations can be added based on specific requirements.
